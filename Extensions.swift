     2.You probably haven't interacted with UIView much or maybe not at all, but let's get our unicorn status to be displayed in the simulator. Don't worry too much about how it's doing it just yet. You'll get into that later on!
     In the ViewController.swift:
     You'll see that we've added something called an IBOutlet to the top called unicornLevelLabel. This represents the object we're going to display our text in.
     unicornLevelLabel has a property text set the value of the property to your name object's unicornLevel property
     Run the program and see your unicorn level displayed in the simulator!
