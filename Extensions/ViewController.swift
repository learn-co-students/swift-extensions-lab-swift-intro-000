//STRING
//Create an extension function for the String class called whisper()
//Returns a String in lowerscase to create a whispering effect
//Create a String extension function for the String class called shout()
//Returns a String in upperscase to create a shouting effect
//Create a String extension computed property for the String class called pigLatin
//Takes the first letter of a word and moves it to the end
//Adds the letters "ay" to the end of the word
//Should be able to handle sentences
//If it's a single letter, it should return the character
//Create an Int extension computed property for the String class called points
//Should calculate the amount of points a given string has
//1 point for consonants and 2 points for vowels
//Ignores spaces and numbers, returns zero for empty strings
//Hint - This is still an extension on the String class
//Note - Y is to be taken as a consonant even though it frequently carries a vowel sound. See Jim for more info

//1.Create a computed extension property on String called unicornLevel

//let unicornPhrase = "My ðŸ¦„ is awesome"

//2.You probably haven't interacted with UIView much or maybe not at all, but let's get our unicorn status to be displayed in the simulator. Don't worry too much about how it's doing it just yet. You'll get into that later on!
//In the ViewController.swift:
//You'll see that we've added something called an IBOutlet to the top called unicornLevelLabel. This represents the object we're going to display our text in.
//unicornLevelLabel has a property text set the value of the property to your name object's unicornLevel property
